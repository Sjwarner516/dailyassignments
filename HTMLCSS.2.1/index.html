  <h1><span>Cake Decorating!</span></h1>
  <hr/>
  <P>When I was a kid I wanted to be a cake decorator when i grew up.
    Unfortunately for me, I have no artistic talent. </P>
    <p>I've taken some classes from local bakers near me and learned there are <span>so many</span> ways to <br/>
    decorate cakes that don't require any freehand art!</p>
    <p>My <span>favorite</span> technique I have learned is making lines. Right now I only make cakes for my three boys on their birthdays. 
    But maybe someday i'll be good enough to sell the occasional cake.  </p>
